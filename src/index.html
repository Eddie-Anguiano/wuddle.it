            Vodka is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and
            ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings.
            Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of fermented cereal
            grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other substances,
            such as fruits or sugar.\r\n\r\nSince the 1890s, the standard
